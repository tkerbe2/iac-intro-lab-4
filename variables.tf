# 1.
#------
# What we're doing here is telling Terraform how to treat these variables by specifying the following:
# Data type, validation and conditions, default values, and if the data is sensitive or not. 

#====================#
# Attributes Section #
#====================#


# 2.
#------
# Our first variable is of the type string and we use it to set our region.

#------
# Notice I've set a default for this variable here. This means that if no value is supplied elsewhere -- the default value will be applied.    
    default     = "us-east-1"

#====================#
# Validation Section #
#====================#
# 4.
# Pretend our organization only allows the use of certain regions. We can create a simple validation condition to ensure only those regions are used. 
# Examine the validation condition carefully. Ask yourself what do you think this code is doing? 

# 5.
# lower() is a function that converts string text to lowercase.
# || is the operator for OR.
# == operator returns true if both objects being compared have the same value and same type.
# example 1: "a" == "b" would return false because although they are both strings - their values are different.
# example 2: "a" == "a" would return trube because both are strings and have the same value.

    description = "Used in naming conventions and tagging to identify the environment type"

# 7.
# Here I've created a validation block inside of my variable. 
# This block basically says the variable has to meet my condition criteria or else it will display an error message.
# This is very similar to what we did above except we're using a built-in function called contains.
# If our variable contains any of the values in the list, it will return true.

# Another great example of something to variabilize. The CIDR block is often something that can be referenced from other resources or functions.
# This represents a way to make our code more dynamic.
