# ðŸ§ª Lab 4 - Testing Variables and Functions with Terraform Console

In this lab you will be introduced to Terraform Console where we can test our variables, functions, data structures, and other logic with the CLI. In this lab you will not deploy any resources to AWS or Azure unless you want to.   


### Resources Created:
This demo does not require you to create resources - it is optional.

<br>

# ðŸ’¡ Terms and Concepts

In this guided exercise you will explore data types and how to use and manipulate them with variables, expressions, and functions. Building on these concepts you will then create some more dynamic code and validate it with Terraform Console. I recommend reading the links below from HashiCorps official documentation before starting the guided exercise. These readings are short and will give you some good fundamental knowledge of what we will cover in this guided exercise.

## Terraform Console

Terraform Console is essentially a Terraform command that opens an interactive command-line console you can interact with. This interactive console allows you to explore expressions and logic without actually creating resources. It can be incredibly useful for troubleshooting and validating your code before trying to deploy it.

# Lab Steps

### 1. Log into Azure and open Cloud Shell
