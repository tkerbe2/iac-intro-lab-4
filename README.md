# ðŸ§ª Lab 4 - Testing Variables and Functions with Terraform Console

In this lab you will be introduced to Terraform Console where we can test our variables, functions, data structures, and other logic with the CLI. In this lab you will not deploy any resources to AWS or Azure unless you want to.   


### Resources Created:
This demo does not require you to create resources - it is optional.

<br>

# ðŸ’¡ Terms and Concepts

In this guided exercise you will explore data types and how to use and manipulate them with variables, expressions, and functions. Building on these concepts you will then create some more dynamic code and validate it with Terraform Console. I recommend reading the links below from HashiCorps official documentation before starting the guided exercise. These readings are short and will give you some good fundamental knowledge of what we will cover in this guided exercise.

## Terraform Console

Terraform Console is essentially a Terraform command that opens an interactive command-line console you can interact with. This interactive console allows you to explore expressions and logic without actually creating resources. It can be incredibly useful for troubleshooting and validating your code before trying to deploy it.

# Lab Steps

### 1. Fork my repo with your own personal GitHub

- I recommend using your own computer with Git and Terraform installed to follow along. Additionally I would open this code with Visual Studio Code.
- Fork this repo so you can have your own version if it to use.

### 2. Analyze the code

- Look at the code and try and figure out what it's creating and look at each resource block.

<br>

<img width="447" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a00a8479-8efc-44ab-af47-22b6b09ade16" />

<br>

- Notice the naming on the tags and how similar it is between resources. This is something we can make more dynamic and reusable with variables.
- Look at other code and see if you can find other patterns like this that could be variabilized. 

```  
tags = {
    Name        = "tkdev-use1-dev-vpc"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

<br>

***

<br>

### 3. Change the tags

- Find all the tags in all of the .tf files and change them to something different. In my example below you can see I've changed them to something different.
- Don't forget you should change these everywhere they exist to be consistent. You will want to change them wherever they exist; security.tf, compute.tf, and vpc.tf.
- It will be easiest to run a find and replace in Visual Studio Code.

<br>

```
tags = {
    Name        = "abc-use1-prod-vpc"
    Environment = "prod"
  }
}
```

<br>

***

<br>

### 4. Change the region

- Next open the providers.tf and change the region to something other than us-east-1.

<br>

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}
```

<br>

- Now that you've changed the region you have to change your tags again for the naming convention to match right?

<br>

```
tags = {
    Name        = "abc-use2-prod-vpc"
    Environment = "prod"
  }
}
```
<br>

- I have now changes my region abbreviation from use1 (us-east-1) to use2 (us-east-2) to match.

<br>

<br>

### 5. Create a new HCP Terraform workspace

- I recommend using Terraform Cloud and creating a new workspace.

<br>

- Using VCS attach it to your GitHub repo that you should have forked from mine.

<br>

<br>

- Add your environment variables.

6. Run a plan and apply

<br>

<br>

- With a successful plan you should see something similiar to my screenshot with 15 new resources to create.

# âœ¨ Congratulations!

***

You've finished this lab and have completed the following items:
- âœ… Created a new AWS account.
- âœ… Logged into your AWS root account.
- âœ… Created an AWS IAM user that will be used for Terraform.
- âœ… Created an access key and secret key with the new user.
